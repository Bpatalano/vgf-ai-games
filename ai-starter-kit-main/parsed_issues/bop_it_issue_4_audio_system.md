# Issue #4: Audio System and Sound Effects

## Summary
Implement comprehensive audio system with command announcements, sound effects, and audio feedback for the Bop-It game.

## Description

- [ ] Adjustable speech rate for different difficulty levels
- [ ] Fallback to pre-recorded audio if TTS fails

### Sound Effects
- [ ] Success sound for correct commands
- [ ] Error sound for incorrect/missed commands
- [ ] Countdown timer tick sounds
- [ ] Game over sound effect
- [ ] Background music (optional, toggleable)

### Audio Feedback
- [ ] Voice activity indicator sounds
- [ ] Button press/interaction sounds
- [ ] Level up/progression sounds
- [ ] High score achievement sound

### Audio Management
- [ ] Master volume control
- [ ] Individual volume controls for effects and voice
- [ ] Mute/unmute functionality
- [ ] Audio settings persistence

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Preload audio assets for smooth playback
- [ ] Minimize audio latency
- [ ] Efficient memory usage
- [ ] Cross-browser audio compatibility
