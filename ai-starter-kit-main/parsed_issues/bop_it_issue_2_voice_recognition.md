# Issue #2: Voice Recognition System

## Summary
Implement robust voice recognition system for detecting and validating Bop-It commands with high accuracy and low latency.

## Description
Create a voice recognition system that accurately detects the 6 core Bop-It commands (BOP, TWIST, PULL, FLICK, SPIN, PASS) with real-time processing and proper error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Voice Command Detection
- [ ] Recognize 6 core commands: "BOP", "TWIST", "PULL", "FLICK", "SPIN", "PASS"
- [ ] Case-insensitive command matching
- [ ] Partial word matching (e.g., "TWIS" matches "TWIST")
- [ ] Filter out background noise and irrelevant speech

### Web Speech API Integration
- [ ] Implement Web Speech API with proper browser support
- [ ] Handle microphone permissions gracefully
- [ ] Continuous speech recognition during gameplay
- [ ] Automatic restart on recognition errors

### Response Time Optimization
- [ ] Process voice commands within 100ms
- [ ] Use interim results for faster detection
- [ ] Implement command confidence scoring
- [ ] Reduce false positives and negatives

### Error Handling
- [ ] Graceful handling of no microphone access
- [ ] Fallback to keyboard input if voice fails
- [ ] Clear error messages for users
- [ ] Automatic retry mechanisms

### Audio Processing
- [ ] Real-time audio level monitoring
- [ ] Noise cancellation techniques
- [ ] Adjust sensitivity based on environment
- [ ] Visual feedback for voice activity
